# eeasy-logistics

Standalone last-mile delivery and warehouse (WMS) product for merchants that run their own drivers and their own stock. Built as one monorepo: Next.js web app, NestJS API, Expo driver app.

**Current phase: architecture.** This repository holds documents only: architecture decision records, the domain model, contracts, and the engineering handbook. No application code lands until the owner approves the foundation package (see `docs/README.md`).

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `adr/` | Architecture decision records, one decision per file, numbered. `adr/README.md` is the index. |
| `docs/handbook/` | How we work: workflow, definition of done, testing, conventions. `AGENTS.md` at the root is the short form every agent and engineer reads first. |
| `docs/architecture/` | Domain model, data architecture, platform blueprint, web, driver app and integration architecture (arrive as later PRs). |
| `docs/contracts/` | OpenAPI documents and the webhook event catalogue (arrive as later PRs). |
| `docs/references/` | Reference-product censuses: Logestechs, OTO Flex, Bolesa (arrive as later PRs). |

## Lineage

This product replaces the Delivery module and the WMS plan that lived inside `Marllow-git/eeasynew` until 2026-10-31. That code is reference material, not a dependency. The one eeasynew capability this product calls is the Eeasy shipping public API, for carrier shipments created at pack time.

## Working rules

Every change arrives as a pull request from a `docs/`, `feat/`, `fix/` or `chore/` branch. Nothing is committed to `main` directly. The owner merges. See `AGENTS.md`.
